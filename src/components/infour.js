                        An Inline Four Engine consists of four cylinders. It fires once every 180Â° crank angle, thus 2 of the pistons
                        are in exactly the same position and move in the same direction, while the remaining 2 pistons are also a pair.
                        Inline Four produce less vibrations and more power. It is easy to maintain than other 4 cylinder configurations
                        and also costs less to make. The firing order of the pistons in this type of configuration is 1-3-4-2 as shown
                        above in the gif.
